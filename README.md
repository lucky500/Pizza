## Disclaimer

I wanted to build a pizza maker, pretty much like the one on the Domino's App. I could not find images anywhere, so I copied images and got inspiration from this project built by Thomas Kolodziejczak  - https://github.com/Thomas-Ko/pizza-builder, I also made use of his method where, the images get matched up with the checkboxes.
